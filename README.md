# Iris_ML
Implementing some machine learning algorithms on the Iris dataset. The dataset is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Uses pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplolib libraries.

I implemented Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest algorithms on the dataset.
The code is run a Jupyter Notebook.
